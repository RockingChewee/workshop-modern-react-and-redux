# Workshop: Modern Web Development With React & Redux
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces developed by Facebook. It uses concept so-called Virtual DOM where all the components actually live. This Virtual DOM approach gives lots of flexibility and boosts the performance because React does smart calculations to minimize the amount of costly operations in the actual DOM.
